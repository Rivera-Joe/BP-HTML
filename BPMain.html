is mostly just a learning exercise and to revamp the idea of javascript and web development as well as to expand

   <p id = "intro" class = "startScreen">In a time long ago; in a land overran with monsters and demons.

  the land. In the world's time of need, that being stood their ground to battle
 the monsters that threatened to take their home.....<br /><br /><br />
 A plan was made by the most creative and intelligent minds that this world had come to know.
 This plan was for the hero to enter the dungeons that the beasts called their home and slay
 their leader. Our story begins here...</p>
